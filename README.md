# Metasave
This project was developed for the Encode Polkadot Hackathon. 

## Concept
Metasave is a data storage protocol for game worlds. The main goal of Metasave is to provide a mechanism where the consequences of one game carry over to any other game in real-time. Using permissionless read access, any game can react to events ocurring in any other game world irrespective of genre, platform, or hardware. To illustrate the concept, we will explore a hypothetical implementation of Metasave involving two popular games at the time of writing: 
* Monster Hunter World
* Rainbow Six Siege
